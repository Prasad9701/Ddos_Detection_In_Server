DDoS attacks are harmful disruptions to computer networks.
This project aims to detect DDoS attacks using machine learning.
Synthetic data is generated to simulate DDoS attacks and normal traffic.
Three algorithms are tested: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks.
These algorithms analyze features like bandwidth and packet rates to make predictions.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1 score are used to compare the algorithms.
The best-performing algorithm is selected for real-time DDoS detection.
Real-time server data is monitored and analyzed by the chosen algorithm.
If the algorithm detects patterns indicative of a DDoS attack, appropriate action is taken to mitigate the attack.
